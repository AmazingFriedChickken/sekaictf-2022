# Broken Converter

## Description

Miku has finally finished her assignment and is ready to submit - but for some reason, the school requires all assignments to be submitted as `.xps` files. Miku found a converter online and used the converted file for submission. The file looked good at first, but it seems as if thereâ€™s something broken in the converter. Can you help her figure out what's wrong?

# flag Mono

## Description

When writing the assignment, Miku used a font called **flag Mono**. Despite it looking just like a regular monospaced font, it claims itself to be **stylistic** in various ways.
  
"Perhaps there's something special about it", Miku thought.
